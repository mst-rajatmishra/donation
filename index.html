									<h2>No more Hunger</h2>
									<p>Facts about Indian Hunger</p>
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p> India, with a population of over 1.5 billion, has seen tremendous growth in the past two decades. Gross Domestic Product has increased 4.6 times and per capita consumption has increased 4 times. Similarly, food grain production has increased almost 2 times. However, despite phenomenal industrial and economic growth and while India produces sufficient food to feed its population, it is unable to provide access to food to a large number of people, especially women and children.</p>
								<p>it is estimated that nearly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year gets lost or wasted. 45 percent of the fruits and vegetables, and 35 percent of cereals that are produced are lost due to inefficient supply chain management and do not reach the consumer markets.Such food could be saved by timely withdrawing it from the distribution network, aggregating it and then redirecting it to the people in need.Also, Food waste generates about 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually and it is the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world.</p>
								<p>In the case of India, the Nation is the second-largest food producer in the World after China contributing to about 10.04% of the total World’s food production. But, an average Indian household wastes 50 kg of food per person per year or 68,760,163 tonnes a year, according to the United Nations Environment Programme's Food Waste Index Report 2021 which has been valued at around INR 92,000 crores. The report explains that around 931 million tonnes of food waste were generated in 2019, 61% of which came from households, 26% from food service and 13% from retail.</p>
